# Box Shooter

This is a Hyper Casual 3D FPS game **Box Shooter** made in _Unity (2018.4.36f1)_.
You control a Crosshair and your goal is to shoot a specified amount of Green Boxes which will give you score to clear the level.
There is a time limit within which you have to finish the game, you can increase your time by shooting the Yellow Boxes but if you hit a Red Box by mistake then your time will get deducted.
In 2nd level, there are moving obstacles too.
